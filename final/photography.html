        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
            During my time at Bandimere Speedway, I photographed hundreds of cars to create custom prints for racers. Utilizing the Adobe Suite and other editing software, I edited images to meet high-quality standards, including precise color correction and enhancements tailored to customer preferences. I managed on-site sales and printing during high-pressure weekend events, troubleshooting technical issues and ensuring seamless use of printing and sales software. By providing exceptional customer service and personalized products, I contributed to a memorable and efficient customer experience at one of Colorado's most memorable drag strips.
