              <p>
                Hi there! I’m a senior at CU, majoring in Strategic Communication with an emphasis in Advertising and a minor in Creative Technology and Design. I’ve gained extensive experience building advertising campaigns and designing impactful branding. I love diving into creative projects that challenge me to think outside the box and bring ideas to life. In my free time, I am a professional photographer with 6+ years of practice capturing stunning visuals. This portfolio is a collection of some of my favorite work, showcasing the passion and creativity I bring to every project.
