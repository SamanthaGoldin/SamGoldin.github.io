        <h2>Queer AF</h2>
        <p>
            For my Capstone project, I worked on a comprehensive campaign for an LGBTQ+ Wedding Showcase held in Denver, Colorado. The event was designed to provide a welcoming and inclusive space for LGBTQ+ couples to connect with vendors and wedding professionals. As part of the campaign, I developed a strategic approach to increasing awareness and driving attendance within the LGBTQ+ community through digital media and targeted outreach. Additionally, I included the design aspects I created in order to give Queer AF a fresh new look for their showcase in 2025!
